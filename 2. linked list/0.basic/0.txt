These are called physical as the determine how the memory is allocated or organised
in memory.
Physical ds will actually store the data.

Physical Ds are of mainly 2 types:
we can have more physical ds using combination of array and linked list
1. array
  ->if length of list is known or fixed then use array
  ->diretly supported by prog. languages.
  ->collection of contigious memory loctions
  ->fixed size     (size of array is static ) can't be changed
  ->can be created in stack or heap

2. linked list
  -> created in heap only
  -> the pointer created in stack to point the node in heap is called HEAD pointer
  -> completely dynamic ds
  -> it is collection of nodes
     (each node has data and link to next node)
  -> length of nodes and be changed dynamically
